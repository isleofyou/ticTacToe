# ticTacToe

This program allows the user to play tic-tac-toe alone or with a friend. The program rotates between players, updates the current player's message, and will automatically add to a player's score and refresh upon a victory. The player that goes first is decided by a randomizer. The program will also know if the game is a draw, will display the "draw" message, and refresh after a delay.

# Goals

The goal of this project was to utilize and implicate all of the knowledge we have gained in class and implement this towards a final, working product. An emphasis existed with the usage of local storage; storing information, retrieving this information on page load, and reincorporating the information to the page after making the data accessable again. 

# Technologies used

- Javascript
- CSS
- HTML

# Challenges

A large challenge I faced with this project was figuring out where to start after the HTML and CSS were completed. I have played Tic Tac Toe since childhood but to actually have a program understand the logic and intricacies if it was difficult. The initial approach was to pseudocode what my intentions were for the program. This helped break down the program into functions that were familiar and managable. 

# Wins

My largest win on this project was the rate at which things were completed. I completed the entire functionality of the program by Saturday afternoon. I give a lot of credit for this to not getting stuck on the CSS portion. There were moments where I would get stuck on the logic of a function, take a break, and then come back to steamroll through the issue refreshed and recharged. Burnout was a major problem on my last projects, and this time I was more conscious of taking breaks.

# Reflection

This project allowed me to gain confidence going into the next module. Though I was anxious starting the project without any real guidance (the rubric did not provide iterations to work through) I overcame this by breaking down all needed functionality and completing them in an order that made sense. This project reinforced the importance of pseudocoding and rubber ducking.
